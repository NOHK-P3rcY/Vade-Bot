Someone besides myself is counting me down. If only I was stricter with myself, I would have gotten this over with in no time. But I wasn't, and there's no point frowning upon it. I was given a second chance, and I had all the leeway to leverage on it.

The emotion I felt grew worse and worse every second over the course of the new age, the second chance I had been given in order to sort things out. The severity was intense enough for me to doubt everything I've bottled up for nearly a year.

If it wasn't for the timely help of my closest friend and the constancy of my newly-found disciple in the process of application for the group I've found myself accustomed to, I would have surely surrendered to the negative vibe that was the entirety of the week in question.

"'yung ngiti mo, kakaiba."

I was making a remarkable smile as I stared at her staring at nothingness? I thought I was smiling as normal. It caught me so off-guard that I covered up my face, looked away, and became extremely self-conscious with my smile, hopefully to no one's notice except his jesting glare.

Making encounters look like coincidences are things I've done one too many times for many people, so doing this feels like a sort of second nature when I want to make things seem unplanned. I'm not sure if this is a skill I should be proud of, though.

Well, I'll always give time for that.

I still couldn't help but get angry at myself whenever I allow this dead air to happen. I still lament on how uninteresting I am that I cannot contribute anything to add to the topics to keep the talking alive.

So, the only thing I can do is stare at her like I always do, my chin resting on both my palms since I'm also animation-locked in place while being the guy people give their payment to for the driver.

She would wake up at random intervals, while I was silently hoping she would notice me just looking at her without a thought in the world but just "She's really cute when she sleeps."

She simply nodded, still half-asleep.

I can do this. I can't let today go to waste.

I coughed slightly, choking on my spit for a few seconds.

"No, wait, three. I have three things to do in SM today."

I didn't answer yet as we both crossed the road. The stoplights weren't working, and the guard wasn't doing anything to assist us, so we winged trying to cross.

I tried maneuvering to her left side to parry oncoming traffic, but to my surprise, she also weaved to my left, just as a taxi halts near her. I'm guessing she moved there since the entrances were sex-segregated.

I tried to bring the agenda topic back before we parted ways, so I digressed as me converged at the front entrance.

"I hope I'm not keeping you from your schedule or anything. Are you planning to do something today?"

"That sounds fun." If you can't tell already, that's looking like a filler phrase when I use it. A personal note on being careful when I use it, though.

She let out a defeated chuckle. She had no choice at all but to take those classes to catch up due to the Department's blind eye.

Let's get back to telling her what's up, shall we?

"Ah, right. About the things I have to do. The first one is about these SM GCs I have. I really don't know where to use them." Plus the fact that I just received another one as a reward for answering a 10-sentence essay for a survey.

Halfway there.

"The second one is for my friend. Magpapatingin siya para sa bagong salamin."

A much delayed half-truth. I already accompanied my friend to do so some weeks ago in Landmark in Trinoma.

I then figured that her red glasses were new. If I remember correctly, she had a more circular black one just last semester.

The time was around 4:30 pm. The aftermath of the rain turned the sunlit sky a faint crimson that will only be visible during the entire sequence. The guardrails we were close to were covered in droplets which persisted onto the metal as circles shaped by perspective with a fixed point miles above the both of us. The only people in that moment besides the persons involved were the lone security guard expressionless in his duty to simply stand there and permit or deny entry to the parking lot, and only a handful of people passing by. Definitely better than a crowd of people that we both know.

We were only meters from the exit, with the guard standing motionless with his stick for inspection. She was about to hit me with the goodbye for the day. I was not gonna have that.

At least, not yet.

"Gab, wait."

Her sights were on the road ahead, her body facing to that direction, ready to leave, until I mentioned those words. She turned slightly to face me.

"…my third agenda is you."

Taken slightly aback, she looked downward. She was all ears this time.

"…okay, so how do I start…?" I thought out loud. The not so scenic urban setting was my unconscious best friend as when I'm at a loss for words, I look far.

After a recognizable beat, it was definitely YOLO.

"I know you've been busy recently, but I just want you to know that we're here– I'm here to support you and every way that I can."

"Nonono I mean, when you feel stressed, feel free to just rant, let it all out. It's just that… I know we haven't been talking a lot recently especially this sem…"

But really, I've always been worried sick about you. Something I wasn't able to say despite all that.

I started to lose my grip on what I wanted to say. I was unconsciously holding myself back from segueing from that sentence to saying that I like her. There felt something amiss for me. This was a dead air characterized by the usual ums and uhhs, alongside some awkward laughing, and all these happened with my unsteady gaze moving from her and the guardrails that I was starting to harass.

If that's not a signal yet, then I don't know what is.

"Oh, really now?" accompanied by even more awkward laughing.

Can I cue even more awkward laughing? I expected a similar response, but that would be after I said anything!

"Well, I'll still go ahead and say it."

Simple is best. I didn't even try to hold her hands just like how I thought I'd do in my simulations.

"Gab, I like you. I really do," as I stared into those bespectacled eyes for the last time.

"Thank you, but I'm sorry. I don't feel the same way."

And all I can do was nod.

…well, until my curiosity got the better of me and approached the next dead air according to one of my first simulations.

"How obvious was I?"

Oh, how scary word of mouth and gossip is. This is a prime example of how far word travels. It reaches to the target before you even sent your own word. That's as equally scary as with a story being transmitted from channels and back to him, already twisted beyond what was actually reported.

This was the start of my impulse taking over. I was getting louder. It's like the entire confession is over, and I've returned to how I usually talk with people, in a loud and obnoxious way.

I tried to continue the hint of casualness by doing something off-script. And yes, at least I had a flow that went on, albeit poorly.

And let's get back to script. 

Saying something out of all the things I want to say highlights which ones are of more priority to convey. The same principle applies with forgetting something you thought you should have remembered, plus the concept of selective memory.

I felt like I was given a second chance. Another opportunity to be with you at least presence-wise. A last time for us to be classmates from the most basic of Hapon to the nitty-gritty social issues there in the land deemed perfect by many other nationalities. Again, I did not say.

"I felt… odd. Confused. It felt to me that due to everything happening with you right now, it was harder to talk to you and approach you."

"I actually felt that from you. I felt the distance and tension that you were feeling. I'm happy for you that you finally got it out of your chest. With you finally saying it, it clears up a lot of things."

That was an equally casual response. It's as if she took the words right out of my mouth. She followed it up with mentioning how observant she can be with different things around her.

"I'm not dense at all."

That was the most relieving thing she's said. Ever. This was also a wake-up call for me to value speed and aggression more, just like my playstyle. Letting food stay in the pan too long will definitely burn it.

"You're a really good friend, and I value everything you've done for me."

Impulse continues.

"I think that should be the real end goal, and I'm glad you see me that way," as I continue to smile like I've never before.

"But yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not looking for a relationship at the moment."

"And neither was I when I fell for you."

Stop it, impulse… Misconstructions are hard to undo. She looked at me puzzled.

"Well, liking someone just happens, right? One just finds out through something crazy like seeing you in my dreams and such."

She was caught a bit off-guard with my remark, laughing it off cutely but awkwardly. It was weird hearing it, but it was more cute for me than awkward, so I'll take it.

Impulse took the wheel again.

"I've burdened a lot of people with this. I've overthought about this to them for too long. Plus, I can't unthink the fact that if natuloy ako sa exchange, I wouldn't have gotten these feelings for you."

A beat, as if it was natural for me to pause there for the misleading weight of that last utterance.

"But I'm glad I didn't. I wouldn't have Overwatch now if I did."

"Yeah, true," followed by a short laugh.

It didn't occur to me then to ask her out to play again sometime.

Alright, impulse. Your time is up. She has to go do her reports. I've kept her long enough. I've thanked her too many times for me to remember each time I did. She must be getting tired of that.

"But I hope this doesn't change anything between us…"

"Yeah, of course."

Did I really need that much reassurance? Or maybe I just wanted hear some sort of yes in this scenario? I don't know, but the clearer everything is, the better.

Speaking of clearer, has she ever gotten to use the mouse I gave her– damn it, impulse.

No need to ask her if it double clicks already. She legit has to go. A 10-hour schedule winding down to 8:30 pm will kill anyone, and she's going to need all the time she can get to prepare.

But I know she can do it. She's strong. She's hardworking. Studious. Passionate with work. Filled with the willpower of a guardian angel.

Gabu-chan'nara, dekiru.

I wanted to say that, but I guess I'll tell her that in some other setting.

"Alright, I won't keep you for longer. Good luck with tomorrow!"

"Thanks! See you tomorrow! Bye~" A farewell in her mellow-energetic tone that I've remarked to myself as a very cute melodious sound to hear no matter what scenario.

She had her bags inspected by the still guard who only moved his hands to assess her items and went on home, only looking forward, never glancing back. All my wandering eyes could do was follow her slow motions as she navigated through the rest of the walkway, into the parking lot where she escapes my line of sight.

I took a moment to assess what just transpired. I leaned at the guardrails, looking towards the place where she stood just a couple of minutes ago.

I remember the imagery. It was a sight I won't be able to forget. A faint crimson light emanating from a star behind the clouds complementing her maroon polo that's arguably long for her, and a slightly puffy or baggy pair of black pants, completed by her apricot-schemed rubber shoes. Her short brown hair in a style that covered her right eye if she let it down fully waved softly at me, all at the will of the cool breeze. Her round face and even puffier cheeks puffed as her peach-colored lips worked out a smile, and eventually, to utter out a line I expected her to say 50%.

And the first thing I felt after realizing that it has come to pass?

I felt free.

Like in an instant, all the anxiety disappeared.

All the overthinking. All the stressing. All the negative vibes. Gone.

Of course I felt sad that I got rejected. Of course I felt disappointed because the confession turned out somewhat lacklustre when compared to the countless simulations I've done in my head. But I kept forgetting that life is not a monologue. The lengthier you make a speech, the more unnatural it gets, especially in a discourse setting.

I also feel bad for misreading her and her being troubled over a lot of things. I think I have this problem of forgetting the basics of everything when things start to get complicated. I forgot about her unshakable will. I forgot she was a person, too, who'll respond accordingly whether or not I finish my monologue.

But one thing's for sure.

I'm more proud of myself for going through with the confession than I am sad about getting rejected.

And I guess it goes without saying that I'm not going to give up just because I got one simple "no". That's not how love works!

Moral of the story? Never bottle up your emotions, because doing so will kill you slowly, paralysis onwards. And, act fast. The YOLO way of doing things in a sense that one should live through stuff without regrets.

So yeah.

I deserve a treat for myself.
