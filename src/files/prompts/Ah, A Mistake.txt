It's like shooting at your own goal thinking it was the opponents'.
It's only ever funny if the blunder wasn't crucial. This is the only kind of schadenfreude I won't regret feeling for anyone.
And depending on the person committing the fail, it's either outrageously funny, incredibly stupefying, head-scratchingly annoying, or downright cute.
That was a flustered face I'm gonna remember for a while.
