It was definitely a bad idea to report in today. But I had no choice.
But after my deed has been done, my body decided to shut down.
Yet even as fate has been cruel to me for so long, I can feel it giving me a pass.
Thanks for your watchful four eyes. You really are my guardian angel.
"I'm not named after one for nothing!"
And to that I ponder. Do headaches turn me into a talkative mess? Then I wish I would have been sick sooner!
